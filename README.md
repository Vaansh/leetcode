# LeetCode

**Adding solutions**

Add file name to directory with the solution directly from LeetCode (ex: `1. Two Sum`).

Run the following to count number of solutions, rename to file name (ex: `0001-two-sum.py`), commit with appropriate message (ex: `added/updated/deleted solution for problem 0001`), and push to repository.

```sh
sh scripts/add.sh
```
